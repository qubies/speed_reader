                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <p>This is a speed reading application that attempts to increase reader comprehension by highlighting important parts of the text for the reader.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3>What do I have to do?</h3>
                    <p>Read the text and answer some multiple choice questions. The text passages are intended to be simple to read, they are aimed at a grade 4-6 level, however the questions are a bit tricky, so try to pay attention as you cannot look at the text when answering the questions.</p>

                    <h3>What if I get the questions wrong?</h3>
                    <p>Not a problem, just do your best. To make sure your privacy is protected, the IDs are randomly generated and the study is double blind. This means that you will either get the AI assistant or be placed in a control group where you will have a hand-crafted agent assist you.</p>

                <br>
                Pressing the <em><strong>UP arrow</em></strong> increases the speed of presentation, and the <em><strong>DOWN arrow</em></strong> decreases it.<br>

                <p><strong>Your goal is to read as fast as you can, but keep in mind that you need to understand the text, as the questions will be directly related to it.</strong> </p>
