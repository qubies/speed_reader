                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <p>This is a speed reading application that attemps to increase reader comprehension by highlighting imortant parts of the text for the reader.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3>What do I have to do?</h3>
                    <p>Not much, just read some text and answer comprehension questions. The text passages are intended to be simple, they are aimed at a grade 4-6 level.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3>I don't want to look stupid if I get it wrong...</h3>
                    <p>Not a problem, we have no way of knowing who did what. The IDs are randomly generated and the study is double blind. This means that you will either get the AI assistant or be placed in a control group where heuristics assist you.</p>

                <p>When you generate an account you are presented with a username and password. This allows you to log in and out and finish your trial.<strong><em>Please only create one account</em></strong></p>
                <p>When you log in there will be a start button, click that when you are ready to read. The reader will display words in the center of your screen, one at a time. This allows you to read without moving your eyes.</p>
                <p>When you are reading the text, you can increase the speed by pressing the <em><strong>UP arrow</em></strong> and decrease it by pressing the <em><strong>DOWN arrow</em></strong>. If you want to rewind the text press the <strong><em> LEFT arrow</strong></em> and to skip a line press the <strong><em>RIGHT arrow</strong></em></p>
                <p>Your goal is to read as fast as you can, but keep in mind that you need to understand the text, as the questions will be directly related to it. </p>
